With the FIPS column sorted A-Z, copy paste this data into one document and save it as a csv in \"Data Downloads\" called countyhealthrankings_ranks_(year).csv with column names \"FIPS\", \"County\", \"Health Outcomes\", \"Health Factors\", \"Length of Life\", \"Quality of Life\", \"Health Behaviors\", \"Clinical Care\", \"Social & Economic Factors\", \"Physical Environment\".  \n",

Next, unmerge the \"Poor or Fair Health\" header and delete everything except for \"Unreliable\", and  \"% Fair or Poor Health\". Do the same for the headers \"Poor physical health days\" and \"Poor mental health days\" and keep only the average number of unhealthy days for each. Unmerge the \"Low birthweight\" header and keep columns \"Unreliable\" and \"% Low birthweight\". Unmerge and keep only the first/primary measure for: Adult smoking, Adult Obesity, Food Environment Index, % Physically inactive, Access to exercise opportunities, excessive drinking. For Alcohol-impaired driving deaths keep \"# Alcohol-Impaired Driving Deaths\", \"# Driving Deaths\", \"% Driving Deaths with Alcohol Involvement\". For Sexually Transmitted Infections keep both the # and rate of Chlamydia. For Teen Births keep only the Teen Birth Rate. Under Uninsured keep the # and % Uninsured. Under Primary Care Physicians, Dentists, and Mental Health Providers keep both the # and Ratio. Delete all preventable hospital stays, mammogramy screenings, flu vaccinations, all educational attainment, unemployment, children in poverty, income inequality, children in single family households, social associations. Under Violent Crime and Injury Deaths keep the #/annual average and the rate. Under Air pollution - particulate matter keep the average daily PM2.5. Delete drinking water violations, severe housing problems, driving alone to work, and long commute-driving alone. At this point you can delete the top row and the \"State\" column. Also, check to see if any counties in the GNRC region are listed as \"unreliable\" and if not, delete these columns as well. \n",
